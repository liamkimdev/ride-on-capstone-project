            <strong>How is it different from Uber and Lyft?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Uber and Lyft focus on an on-demand type of business model where you
            request a ride and someone with a car will accommodate to your
            desires, in other words the passenger is the one who runs the show
            and the driver follows along. With Ride on, the driver is the one
            making the decision on where to go and the passenger tags along.
          </p>

          <p>And most importantly, much cheaper than Uber and Lyft!</p>
