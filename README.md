# RIDE-ON
Capstone project for cohort 39 of dev-10 

What is the primary goal of this application?
* Aimed to instill faith and trust in community by connecting drivers of everyday trips with passengers looking for a ride to the same destination. All while saving money and resources, reducing traffic congestion, limiting enviromental impacts and fostering friendships along the way.
* In the future, we also aim to connect employees within a company and students within a university.

What are the features of this application?
* “Ride On” is an online marketplace for carpooling. Its website and mobile apps connect drivers and passengers willing to travel together between cities and share the cost of journey. The company does not own any vehicle; This application makes it fun and affordable to carpool from city-to-city in the United States of America. Save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and make new friends!

How is it different from Uber and Lyft?
* Uber and Lyft focus on an on-demand type of business model where you request a ride and someone with a car will accommodate to your desires, in other words the passenger is the one who runs the show and the driver follows along.  With Ride on, the driver is the one making the decision on where to go and the passenger tags along.
* And most importantly, much cheaper than Uber and Lyft!

Safety concerns?
* Safety is our number one priority
* We go the extra mile to ensure members have a safe experience on “Ride On”, such as, verifying users via identifciation, choose who you travel with, admin monitors actively and closely through GPS tracker, user's car is covered by car insurance, and more!
