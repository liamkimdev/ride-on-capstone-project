# RIDE-ON

# What is the primary goal of this application?

"Ride On" aimes to instill faith and trust in the community by connecting drivers of everyday trips with passengers looking for a ride to the same destination. All while saving money and resources, reducing traffic congestion, limiting environmental impacts, and fostering friendships along the way.

Future Goal: connect company employees and university students

# What are the features of this application?

“Ride On” is an online marketplace for carpooling. Its website and mobile apps connect drivers and passengers willing to travel together between cities and share the journey cost. The company does not own any vehicle. This application makes it fun and affordable to carpool from city to city in the United States of America. Save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and make new friends.

# Safety concerns?

Safety is our number one priority! We verify users via identification. Allow users to choose who they travel with. Provide active admin monitoring of trips through GPS tracking. Guarantee that drivers are registured and insured, and more! We go the extra mile to ensure members have a safe experience using “Ride On”

# How is it different from Uber and Lyft?

With Ride on, the driver is the one making the decision on where to go and the passenger tags along. Uber and Lyft focus on an on-demand type of business model where you request a ride and someone with a car will accommodate to your desires, in other words the passenger is the one who runs the show and the driver follows along. And most importantly, much cheaper than Uber and Lyft!
